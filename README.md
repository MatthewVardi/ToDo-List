# Basic to do app 
---

## Will be using Node/Express and MongoDB, following  RESTful Routing and CRUD.

##Current state:
  *Create route exists
  *Front end html fixed
  *Delete button works corectly
  *Edit task works correctly
  *No Show route because tasks are relatively short
  *CRUD Complete
  *User authentication is complete
  *User authorization working, cannot view todo page unless logged in
  *Completed greeting for logged in users
  *Tasks are now only displayed if the current user "owns" them, effectively not allowing  users to  modify other users tasks

##Next Stages
  *flash error messages for registration errors or successful logins
  *refactoring app.js, create a folder for routes and models
