Basic to do app 

Will be using Node/Express and MongoDB, following  RESTful Routing and CRUD.

Current state:
-Create route exists
-Front end html fixed
-Delete button works corectly
-Edit task works correctly
-No Show route because tasks are relatively short
-CRUD Complete

**User authentication is next
App should show tasks related to only that user and none if you are not logged in
