# Basic to do app 

## Will be using Node/Express and MongoDB, following  RESTful Routing and CRUD.

## Current state:
* Create route exists
* Front end html fixed
* Delete button works corectly
* Edit task works correctly
* No Show route because tasks are relatively short
* CRUD Complete
* User authentication is complete
* User authorization working, cannot view todo page unless logged in
* Completed greeting for logged in users
* Tasks are now only displayed if the current user "owns" them, effectively not allowing  users to  modify other users tasks
* directories for routes and mongoose models exist now - decluttering app.js

## Next Stages
* refactoring app.js, create a folder for routes and models
